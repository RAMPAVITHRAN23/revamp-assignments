    <h2>Transport</h2>

    <p> Transport (in British English) or transportation (in American English) is the intentional movement of humans,
        animals, and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water,
        cable, pipelines, and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations. Transport
        enables human trade, which is essential for the development of civilizations.

        Transport infrastructure consists of both fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways,
        canals, and pipelines, and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking
        terminals, refueling depots (including fuel docks and fuel stations), and seaports. Terminals may be used both
        for the interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.

        Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport facilities used to carry people or cargo. They
        may include vehicles, riding animals, and pack animals. Vehicles may include wagons, automobiles, bicycles,
        buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft, and aircraft.</p>

    <h2>Modes of Transport</h2>
    <h4>Main article:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_transport"> modes of transport</a></h4>
    <div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a certain type of vehicle, infrastructure, and
            operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the
            latter case being called inter-modal or multi-modal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and
            disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route.

            Governments deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including
            financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure
            can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.

            Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services, or private. Freight transport
            has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items.
            Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution
            and use large amounts of land. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is
            essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl.</p>

    <h2>AIR TRANSPORT</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            A fixed-wing aircraft, commonly called an airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in
            relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing
            aircraft, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A gyroplane is both
            fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large
            airliners and military cargo aircraft.

            Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing. The majority
            of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure for maintenance, restocking, and refueling and for
            the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers.[1] While the vast majority of aircraft land and
            take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.

            The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket. Commercial jets can reach up to
            955 kilometres per hour (593 mph), single-engine aircraft 555 kilometres per hour (345 mph). Aviation is
            able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs
            and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, helicopters can be used.[2] As of April 28,
            2009, The Guardian article notes that "the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any
            time."[3]

        <h2>Road Transport</h2>
        <h4>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_transport"> Road_transport</a></h4>

        <p class="road">
            A road is an identifiable route, way, or path between two or more places.[5] Roads are typically smoothed,
            paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;[6] though they need not be, and historically many roads
            were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance.[7] In urban areas, roads may
            pass through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and
            route.[8]

            The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor.
            Other users of roads include buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians. As of 2010, there were
            1.015 billion automobiles worldwide. Road transport offers complete freedom to road users to transfer the
            vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This
            flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes
            of transport. It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.

            Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the
            main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities;[9] buses allow for more efficient travel at the
            cost of reduced flexibility.[4] Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight
            transport.

        <h2>Water transport</h2>
        <h4>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_transport"> Maritime_transport</a></h4>
        <p class="water">
            Water transport is movement by means of a watercraft—such as a barge, boat, ship, or sailboat—over a body of
            water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal, or river. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making
            the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance, and appearance.

            In the 19th century, the first steam ships were developed, using a steam engine to drive a paddle wheel or
            propeller to move the ship. The steam was produced in a boiler using wood or coal and fed through a steam
            external combustion engine. Now most ships have an internal combustion engine using a slightly refined type
            of petroleum called bunker fuel. Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam.
            Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion
            engines to drive one or more propellers or, in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft
            areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See Marine propulsion.)

            Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of
            transporting large quantities of goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion
            tons of cargo in 2007.[10] Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for
            transcontinental shipping;[11] short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.[12][13]
