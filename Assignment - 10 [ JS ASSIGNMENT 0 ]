JavaScript Fundamentals Assignment

What is JavaScript?
JS is a versatile programing lannguage used for web devlopment. They are used to create the dynamic and respomsove web pages with the real time datas

Variables and Types:
  let userAge = 25;
  let userName = "ram";
  console.log("User Age:", userAge);
  console.log("User Name:", userName);

Comments in JavaScript:
/*
  this function is designed to greet the user
*/

Write a multi-line comment explaining the purpose of a function you create in the next step.
Operations:
  let num1 = 10;
  let num2 = 20;
/add
  let sum = num1 + num2;
/sub
  let difference = num1 - num2;
/mul
  let product = num1 * num2;
/div
  let quotient = num1 / num2;
console.log("Sum:",sum);
console.log("Difference:", difference);
console.log("Product:", product);
console.log("Quotient:", quotient);

Data Types:
string
  let greeting = "hello world";
  console.log("String:", greeting);

Number
  let age = 30;
  console.log("Number:", age);

Boolean
  let isLoggedIn = true;
  console.log("Boolean:", isLoggedIn);

  }

FOR LOOP:
  for (let i=1; i<=5; i++)
  {
    console.log(i);
  }

Loose vs Strict Equality:

Loose Equality:
  Compares 2 values for equality after converting both valies to a common type.It is less strict
because it does not consider the type of variable.
  console.log(5 == '5')
output: true
Strict Equality:
  Compares 2 values for equality without converting them to a common type. It is strict
because it considers both the value.
  console.log(5 == '5') 
output: false
